# Plan 2026

`plan2026` is a Next.js App Router task and plan app with Google sign-in, per-user task and plan storage in PostgreSQL, optional rich task notes, urgency levels, due dates, and Google Calendar event creation.

## Features

- Google sign-in with NextAuth v4 and Prisma-backed database sessions
- **Tasks** – A single `/tasks` page for day-to-day work:
  - Optional completed-task visibility with a `showCompleted=1` toggle
  - Add and edit tasks in dialogs (title, rich text notes, due date, urgency 1–7)
  - Mark tasks done, restore them, or delete them
  - Export tasks (or a single task from the edit dialog) to JSON for debugging or AI ingestion
  - Add a task to Google Calendar and keep track of whether it has already been linked
  - Tasks can be linked to a plan; task rows show a “Plan: …” link when set
- **Plans** – A `/plans` area to group tasks and track progress:
  - List of plans ordered by priority (1–7, like task urgency); each plan has name, status (draft / started / on hold / completed / abandoned), percent completed, dates, and optional image (paste URL)
  - Refresh button and “Show completed / abandoned” toggle on the plans list; each row has an Edit link and a status dropdown
  - Full-page create at `/plans/new` and edit at `/plans/[id]` (no modals)
  - Add existing tasks or create new tasks when editing a plan; on the plan detail page you can edit any task in the plan via an edit-task modal
  - Export plans (or a single plan from its detail page) to JSON for debugging or AI ingestion
  - Plan fields: goal, actual start/end dates, notes, color
- Settings page to disconnect Google Calendar access
- Server actions for UI mutations and JSON API routes for programmatic access

- Tailwind CSS v4
- Prisma ORM
- PostgreSQL
- NextAuth v4
- Zod
- Tiptap
- Sonner

## Requirements

- Node.js installed
- A PostgreSQL database for local development and testing
- A Google OAuth client with Calendar access enabled

## Environment variables

Set these in `.env` for local development:

- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `AUTH_SECRET` - NextAuth secret (required in production; see [DEPLOY.md](./DEPLOY.md) for secret rotation)
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` - Google OAuth client id
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` - Google OAuth client secret
- `NEXTAUTH_URL` - usually `http://localhost:3000` locally
- `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` - (optional) Vercel Blob token for task file attachments; create a Blob store in the Vercel project and pull env with `vercel env pull`
- `AUTH_FACEBOOK_ID` - (optional) Facebook app client ID for Facebook login
- `AUTH_FACEBOOK_SECRET` - (optional) Facebook app client secret; when set with `AUTH_FACEBOOK_ID`, the login page shows "Continue with Facebook"

## Local development

This app uses PostgreSQL in every environment, including local development, local testing, and production.

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Configure the environment variables listed above in `.env`, pointing `DATABASE_URL` at your local development or test Postgres database.

3. Run Prisma migrations against your local Postgres database:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```

4. Start the app:

```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open `http://localhost:3000`.

## Testing

The project uses [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for unit and integration tests. Run tests with:

- `npm test` – run tests once
- `npm run test:watch` – run tests in watch mode
- `npm run test:coverage` – run tests with coverage report

Tests live next to source files (e.g. `src/lib/export.test.ts`). Good candidates for unit tests:

- **`src/lib/*`** – export helpers, sanitize, validations, rate limiter (no DB)
- **Zod schemas** – parse/refine behavior in `src/lib/validations/task.ts` and `plan.ts`

For React components, add `@vitest-environment jsdom` at the top of the test file and use [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/react) (already installed). For API routes or server actions that hit the database, use a test database or mock Prisma. Optional: [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for end-to-end flows (e.g. login, create task).

### Before you push

A **pre-push** Git hook (via [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/)) runs `npm run prepush`, which runs **lint**, **typecheck**, and **next build** (without `prisma generate`). That way you can push while the dev server is running without hitting a Prisma engine lock on Windows; full `npm run build` (with Prisma generate) runs in CI. To run the same checks manually: `npm run prepush`. For a full build including Prisma: `npm run build`.

### Port 3000 already in use

If you see **"Port 3000 is in use"** or **"Unable to acquire lock at .next/dev/lock"**, a previous dev server is still running. On Windows this often happens when the terminal is closed without stopping the server, or when the process doesn’t receive a shutdown signal.

- **Stop the server properly:** Use **Ctrl+C** in the terminal where `npm run dev` is running instead of closing the window.
- **Free the port:** Run `npm run dev:kill` to kill the process on port 3000, then run `npm run dev` again.
- **Manual kill (Windows):** `netstat -ano | findstr :3000`, then `taskkill /PID <pid> /F`. Or use Task Manager → Details → end the `node.exe` process (or "End process tree" on the npm parent).

The root route redirects to `/tasks`. The app shell includes **Tasks**, **Plans**, **Help**, and **About** nav links; **Plans** lists your plans and links to **Add plan** (`/plans/new`) and to each plan’s detail/edit page (`/plans/[id]`). **Help** (`/help`) shows how to use tasks and plans plus recent updates; **About** (`/about`) shows app version and contributor info.

## Google OAuth setup

In Google Cloud Console:

1. Enable the Google Calendar API for the same project as your OAuth client.
2. Add this local origin:
   - `http://localhost:3000`
3. Add this local redirect URI:
   - `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google`

The app requests these Google scopes during sign-in:

- `openid`
- `email`
- `profile`
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events`

Google sign-in forces a fresh Google consent step so revoked Calendar permissions can be granted again on reconnect.

## Facebook login (optional)

To enable "Continue with Facebook" on the login page:

1. Create an app at [developers.facebook.com](https://developers.facebook.com/) and add the **Facebook Login** product.
2. In Facebook Login settings, add a **Valid OAuth Redirect URI**: `https://<your-domain>/api/auth/callback/facebook` (e.g. `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/facebook` for local dev).
3. Set `AUTH_FACEBOOK_ID` and `AUTH_FACEBOOK_SECRET` in your environment (from the app’s Settings → Basic).
4. Request only the permissions you need (e.g. `email`, `public_profile`). App Review may be required for certain permissions.

## API

- `GET /api/tasks` - list all tasks for the signed-in user (includes `plan` and `attachments`)
- `POST /api/tasks` - create a task
- `PATCH /api/tasks/:id` - mark a task complete or restore it
- `DELETE /api/tasks/:id` - delete a task
- `POST /api/tasks/:id/calendar` - create a Google Calendar event for a task
- `GET /api/plans` - list plans for the signed-in user (owned + shared). Query: `page`, `limit`, `showArchived=1`
- `POST /api/plans/cleanup-invites` - delete expired plan invites (e.g. for cron). Requires auth.

### `POST /api/tasks` body

```json
{
  "title": "Book flights",
  "content": "<p>Use the points portal first.</p>",
  "dueAt": "2026-03-10T14:30",
  "urgency": 4,
  "planId": "c..."
}
```

Notes:

- `title` is required
- `content` is optional rich text HTML and is sanitized before storing/rendering
- `dueAt` is optional; when present it is converted to a date
- `urgency` is optional and defaults to `4` (1–7)
- `planId` is optional; when present the plan must exist and be owned by the user

### `PATCH /api/tasks/:id` body

```json
{
  "completed": true
}
```

## Assets

- **Header logo:** `public/plan2026-logo-c.png` — trimmed in GIMP to remove transparent padding (TECH-0033). If you replace it, crop tight to the artwork or the header may show extra space.

## Deployment

Deployment instructions live in **[DEPLOY.md](./DEPLOY.md)**.

In short:

1. Create a Vercel project.
2. Provision PostgreSQL and set the required env vars.
3. Configure Google OAuth with your production callback URL and Calendar API access.
4. Deploy; the build runs `prisma generate` and `next build`, and migrations are applied with `prisma migrate deploy`.

The database story is intentionally the same in every environment: PostgreSQL for local work and PostgreSQL in production.
